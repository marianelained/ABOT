Simulate animation that relies on a countdown timer using Android Studio in Java Language.

About the User Interface:

1. **activity_animation_time.xml:** This file is like a blueprint for how the screen will look in your app. It tells the app what elements to put on the screen and where to put them. In this case, it needs to include things like a box where you can type numbers (EditText), an area where the app will show results (TextView), a space for a countdown timer (also TextView), a little picture that will pulse (ImageView), and buttons to start and stop things (Buttons).

2. **anim/pulsing_animation.xml**: This is a file that tells the app how to make the little picture pulse. It's a set of instructions for it to move to create that pulsing effect.

Once you've got these files ready, put them together in the right way:

- First, you design your screen using the activity_animation_time.xml file. You decide where everything goes and how it looks.
- Then, you use the pulsing_animation.xml file to make the little picture pulse. 
- After that, when someone opens your app and taps on the right button, the app follows the instructions in the Java code to start the countdown timer and make the picture pulse. It's like pressing play on a video that shows the dance move you taught it.
- If you want to stop the countdown or the pulsing, there's another button that tells the app to stop. It's like hitting pause on the dance video.

With all these pieces in place, your app should work smoothly and do its cool countdown and pulsing animation when you want it to. :)
